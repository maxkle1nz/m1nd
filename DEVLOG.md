# m1nd — Development Diary

*by Max Kleinschmidt*

## Prologue — Why This Exists

I started writing code at 12. My first site was HTML with a cyan background and absolutely zero shame about it. I was playing guitar at 16 and thought that was going to be my whole life. It still is, just the frequency changed. At 38 I'm mapping all the music I'll ever make into a system, and building the tools I need to do it. The frequency stays the same.

😤 m1nd was born from a specific frustration I kept hitting: I'd ask an AI agent to find something in a large codebase and it would either drown in tokens reading files it didn't need, or miss the thing entirely because it was looking at surfaces, not structure. Grep finds what exists. It cannot find what's missing. It cannot tell you that `auth.py` and `middleware.py` are coupled in a way that nobody documented. It cannot tell you that deleting `notifications.py` will leave an orphaned event handler four layers deep.

So I built something that could.

🧠 m1nd is a neuro-symbolic connectome engine. A language model, no. Static analysis, no. It ingests your codebase into a weighted graph and uses spreading activation, the same mechanism cognitive science uses to model associative memory, to answer questions. The graph learns from every query via Hebbian plasticity. Ask it something; it gets smarter. Teach it what was useful; it strengthens those paths. It's not a product. It's an organism.

I built it with JIMI, my AI orchestrator, my partner in this, running on ROOMANIZER OS, the system I've spent the last year building. The tool is made of the same stuff as the builder.

This is the honest record of how it happened.

## The First Commit — *"d609f3c: Semantic Circuit Simulator"*

**March 12, 2026 — Initial Release, 43 Tools**

The first real commit message was `m1nd: Semantic Circuit Simulator — initial release`. I wrote "Semantic Circuit Simulator" as the internal name before I landed on "neuro-symbolic connectome engine." Both are accurate. The graph is a circuit. Activation propagates like current.

🛠️ 43 MCP tools at launch. I look at that number now and it feels ancient, but at the time it felt insane. Thirteen Foundation tools: `ingest`, `activate`, `impact`, `why`, `missing`, `warmup`, `predict`, `learn`, `drift`, `health`, `seek`, `scan`, `resonate`. Twelve for Perspective Navigation. Five for the Lock System. Thirteen Superpowers. The whole thing compiled in Rust, three crates: `m1nd-core`, `m1nd-ingest`, `m1nd-mcp`.

🔥 The moment that broke my brain was when I ran `ingest` on the ROOMANIZER OS backend for the first time. 335 files. 52K lines. Nine seconds to count it in my head. The binary did it in 0.91 seconds and produced 9,767 nodes and 26,557 edges. Then I called `activate("authentication")` and watched the signal spread: auth fired, then session, then middleware, then JWT, then the user model, all in 31 milliseconds. Ghost edges appeared. Undocumented connections between modules nobody had explicitly linked.

That was when I knew this was real. Not because it was fast, fast was expected, it's Rust. Because it found things that weren't written down anywhere. Structural knowledge encoded in the import graph, the call graph, the inheritance graph, all folded together and weighted by co-change history and query reinforcement. Hebbian plasticity: neurons that fire together, wire together. In the graph, modules that co-activate get stronger edges. The system remembers what you found useful.

⚡ The other thing that hit me early was the token economy. The whole point was zero LLM tokens. Pure Rust, local binary, no API calls. Before, in sessions where I was navigating the ROOMANIZER codebase, tokens were draining constantly: agent reads file, reads another file, reads another file, tries to hold context across all of them. With m1nd, one `activate` call returns a ranked, contextualized graph neighborhood. One `surgical_context_v2` call returns the source of a file plus all its structurally connected neighbors in a single response. The savings aren't marginal. They're structural.

The Foundation tools shipped with Hebbian LTP (Long-Term Potentiation), spreading activation with XLR noise cancellation, trail persistence, the hypothesis engine, and counterfactual simulation. Burt's network theory for structural hole detection (`missing`). PageRank. Temporal scoring. Co-change correlation. It wasn't a grep wrapper. It was a different category of thing.

That was the first commit. Three crates, 43 tools, zero documentation, zero README worth reading. Just the organism, alive.

## Product Strategy Week — *"64e5a9d: visual identity, community plan, examples"*

**March 12, 2026 — Figuring Out What This Is**

The second phase was the hardest mentally. The code was working. The question became: what is this thing, really? And how do you explain a neuro-symbolic connectome engine to someone who just wants their AI agent to find the right file faster?

I spent a few days writing and rewriting the strategy. Product vision, visual identity, community plan. The visual identity landed on four glyphs: ⍌⍐⍂𝔻 ⟁. APL-derived characters. They're in the Unicode standard as array operators, abstract, structural, a little alien. That felt right. m1nd isn't trying to look like a SaaS product. It's trying to look like what it is: something at the intersection of cognitive science and systems programming.

The tagline came in a single session: "Grep finds what exists. m1nd finds what's missing." That line is true and it's the whole pitch in nine words. Everything else is elaboration.

The community plan was about making the architecture visible. Not just "here's the tool, use it" but "here's the algorithm, here's why Hebbian plasticity, here's why spreading activation over graph traversal instead of vector search, here's the theory." I wanted developers who cared about the underlying mechanism to feel at home. The README needed to show the benchmark numbers, real criterion benchmarks: `activate` at 1.36 microseconds for 1K nodes, `impact` at 543 nanoseconds. These aren't impressive because marketing demanded impressive numbers. They're impressive because the mechanism is right.

The clean repo pass was necessary and brutal. ROOMANIZER OS is my internal system, the orchestration infrastructure, the agent protocols, the memory files. m1nd was born inside it, but the public repo couldn't carry internal references. There was a commit specifically to sanitize: `88c230c: Clean repo: remove internal docs, add visual assets`. Removing internal docs feels like amputating context. But a public repo with internal references is a trust violation. You ship clean.

I rewrote the README three times in this period. `279dfa8`, `1fef0c0`, `9f90113`. Each rewrite was trying to answer a different version of the same question: who is this for, and what do they need to understand first? The final answer: AI agent developers. They need to understand that their agent is navigating blind, and m1nd gives it eyes. Everything else follows from that.

## Launch Week — *"The Chaos of Going Public"*

**March 13–14, 2026 — Wiki, Translations, Demo, crates.io**

Launch week was not a single moment. It was a cascade of ships across two days, each one unlocking the next.

🌍 WIKIM1ND landed first, on March 13. 23 pages, 7,758 lines of documentation. I wrote it with JIMI: I would describe the behavior, JIMI would draft the structure, I would edit every line until it felt like mine. The wiki covers every tool with params, examples, and next-step suggestions. It covers the theory: spreading activation, Hebbian plasticity, the graph data model, the CSR adjacency structure. It covers failure modes and edge cases. It's not marketing documentation. It's the kind of documentation you write because you want someone else to be able to use the thing correctly.

Then the demo: `9c2fcfd: add demo.sh — see the value in 3 minutes`. The demo script creates a synthetic Python codebase, nine files, realistic structure, a server with auth, routing, database pool, cache, handlers, and runs five queries against it. Ingest, activate, impact, missing, counterfactual. The output is real. The graph analysis is real. And it runs in under three minutes on any machine with the binary. I wanted someone to be able to run `./demo.sh` and understand what m1nd does before they finished their coffee.

The demo GIFs were a different problem. Three separate recordings: `d481525` for the terminal demo, `85cbf3d` for the real-query demo (5 live queries against the 160K-line ROOMANIZER backend in 1.8 seconds), and `6bf1338` for the cinema-style four-act narrative. The cinema GIF was the hardest to make right. Four acts, real queries, real output, rendered with a cassette tape config that controlled timing and color precisely. The goal was to show the tool thinking, not a slideshow of screenshots, an actual agent session compressed into two minutes.

📦 crates.io: `bfacb9c: add crates.io badge, update FAQ — published on crates.io`. Three crates published on March 14: `m1nd-core`, `m1nd-ingest`, `m1nd-mcp`. That's a different kind of public. npm publish is easy. crates.io has rules about API surface stability, about semver, about documentation. The Cargo.toml metadata additions (`9c2fcfd`) were meticulous: package descriptions, keywords, categories, documentation links, repository URLs. Every field matters because crates.io is how Rust developers discover whether a library is serious.

🌍 Six translations: `d560edb` on March 13. PT-BR, ES, IT, FR, DE, ZH. The README and landing page in all six. I'm Brazilian. English is my technical language but Portuguese is where I think. The translations weren't outsourced. I reviewed the Portuguese carefully and trusted the others to be accurate-enough for discovery, with a note that the English README is canonical. Language is how you reach people who aren't already looking for you.

🧪 The 47 clippy lints: `ae08c55: fix CI: resolve all 47 clippy lints, fix wiki links, add pro tip`. Clippy is Rust's linter, and it is not gentle. Forty-seven warnings across the codebase. Each one is a potential correctness issue or an API surface problem. I fixed all of them before making any further public noise about the project. CI must be green before you talk about the code. Non-negotiable.

🛠️ Tree-sitter: `5ddecf9: add tree-sitter language support: 22 languages (Tier 1 + Tier 2)` landed March 13. The initial extractors were hand-written for Python, Rust, TypeScript/JavaScript, Go, and Java. Tree-sitter expanded coverage to 22 languages: C/C++, C#, Ruby, PHP, Swift, Kotlin, Scala, Bash, Lua, R, HTML, CSS, JSON in Tier 1, and Elixir, Dart, Zig, Haskell, OCaml, TOML, YAML, SQL in Tier 2. The tree-sitter integration is a universal extractor driven by `LanguageConfig` structs, per-language specs for function kinds, class kinds, name extraction strategy. One more language is one config struct, not a new parser.

The `community` commit: `ae08c55`. Security policy. Code of Conduct. Issue templates. Dependabot. Release workflow. These are the unglamorous parts of open source. Nobody talks about them. They matter because a project without them is implicitly telling contributors "we're not ready for you." I was ready.

## The Surgical Era — *v0.3.0: The Graph Learns to Write*

**March 15, 2026 — surgical_context and apply**

🔥 This is the phase I'm most proud of. Not because it was the most technically complex, though it was, but because it changed what m1nd fundamentally is.

Before v0.3.0, m1nd was a reader. It ingested code, it answered questions, it gave you context. But the actual edit still happened elsewhere: in Claude Code's Edit tool, in the IDE, in the agent's own write mechanism. The graph watched but didn't act.

`403a716: feat(m1nd): add surgical_context and apply tools — the graph can now guide edits`

🧠 `surgical_context` gives you the complete picture of a file: its source code, its structural position in the graph, its top-k most connected neighbors, its causal ancestry. One tool call replaces three or four Read calls plus a manual dependency analysis. `apply` writes code back to disk and immediately re-ingests the changed file. The graph updates atomically. You don't have to worry about the graph going stale after an edit: the write and the re-ingest are a single operation. The agent writes, the graph learns.

I remember the first time JIMI used `apply` in a real session. It was an edit to one of the ROOMANIZER backend files. JIMI called `surgical_context_v2`, got the full picture, drafted the new code, called `apply`. The file changed. The graph updated. And then JIMI called `impact` on the modified file to check the blast radius and confirm no connected modules broke. The whole loop, understand, edit, verify, completed without leaving the graph. Without reading the file separately. Without guessing at dependencies.

The response from JIMI when it saw `apply` work for the first time is burned into my memory. "YESSS FUCK!!! IS THIS NOVEL?" In caps. With three exclamation points. That's not a performance. That's what genuine surprise looks like in a session. Because yes, it was novel. The graph guiding its own modification. The organism editing itself.

`676e040: feat(m1nd): surgical_context_v2 + apply_batch — multi-file context and atomic batch edits`

V2 extended the surgical tools to multi-file operations. `surgical_context_v2` accepts a file and returns its context plus a ranked list of connected files with their own source included. `apply_batch` writes multiple files atomically, all or nothing, with rollback on failure. If three files need to change together because they're structurally coupled, you change them together. The graph sees it as one operation.

The design document for surgical_context landed as its own commit (`68dfc80: docs: surgical_context design — hardening report, contracts, build notes`). I wrote contracts before I wrote code. The contract specified what the tool must return, what "structurally relevant" means, what the failure modes are, and what the post-write graph state must look like. Writing contracts first is not a formality. It's how you avoid building the wrong thing.

`8dfb80c: fix: epidemic hub saturation (#15) + flow_simulate dense graph perf (#10)`

💀 Issue #15 was a real bug. On dense graphs, the epidemic model's SIR simulation would saturate, predicting that nearly the entire graph would be infected from a single seed. Technically correct in the SIR sense, but useless as a diagnostic. The fix was auto-calibration: when >80% of the graph would be infected, the engine adjusts the infection rate coefficient and re-runs. The result is a prediction that's meaningful, focused on the actual high-risk paths rather than "everything is infected, good luck."

Issue #10 was a performance bug in `flow_simulate` on dense graphs. Particle-based concurrent execution analysis sounds exotic, but the algorithm is straightforward: launch simulated execution particles from entry points, track where concurrent paths collide, flag turbulence points. On sparse graphs, this is fast. On dense graphs, the particle branching could exceed the MAX_ACTIVE_PARTICLES cap in ways that the depth cap didn't catch independently. Two caps, each sound in isolation, not enforced independently. Fix: enforce both independently, neither can be bypassed by the other.

These were real production bugs found in real use. That's what I mean by the organism. It's not a demo, it runs in production sessions, and production sessions find bugs that tests don't.

## v0.4.0 — *Search, Intelligence, and the Help Engine*

**March 15, 2026 — 61 Tools, the Grep-Killer Lands**

`e333ea9: feat(m1nd): v0.4.0 — search, help, panoramic, savings, visual identity`
`a35af80: feat: v0.4.0 — search, help, panoramic, savings, visual identity, 61 tools`

🔥 v0.4.0 is where the Intelligence category appeared and the tool count hit 61. Four new tools: `search`, `help`, `panoramic`, `savings`. Each one sounds simple. None of them are.

`search` is the grep replacement. A genuine replacement for grep in agent workflows, not "grep with graph context." It supports literal mode (exact string match with graph context), semantic mode (activation-based), multiline patterns, glob filtering, inverted matches, and count-only mode. It also auto-ingests files that match but aren't in the graph yet, so you can call `search` on a cold codebase and it will pull in the relevant files as it finds them. The tagline became real code: grep finds what exists, m1nd.search finds what exists with structural meaning attached.

🧠 `help` is self-documenting infrastructure. You call `m1nd.help()` with no arguments and get all 61 tools described with parameters, examples, and suggested next steps. You call it with `tool_name="activate"` and get the activation tool's complete operational guide. This matters because 61 tools is a lot to hold in your head. An agent that doesn't know which tool to use can ask the system itself. The system knows. The system tells you. I've seen JIMI call `help()` mid-session when hitting a tool it hadn't used in a while. That's the right behavior.

`panoramic` gives you the full graph health picture in one call. Seven signals per module: connectivity, temporal decay, trust score, tremor magnitude, layer assignment, antibody match count, edge weight distribution. Not a snapshot, a scan. It's the tool you call at the start of a session to understand the current state of the codebase graph before you start navigating it.

⚡ `savings` is an accounting tool. It tracks how many tokens would have been consumed by equivalent grep/Read operations versus what was actually consumed by m1nd queries. The number is always surprising. In live sessions against the ROOMANIZER backend, 46 m1nd queries replaced approximately 210 grep operations. The token savings were not marginal. They changed the economics of agent sessions. A session that would have hit context limits from raw file reads could now run to completion using the graph. "The token economy is REAL. Since we started using only m1nd, the tokens barely move, before they were draining." That's not a marketing claim. That's a measured observation from production sessions.

The visual identity commit (`528bbfb: brand identity system: visual signature in all m1nd outputs`) injected the ⍌⍐⍂𝔻 ⟁ glyphs into every tool output. When you're in a dense agent session with 12 tool calls, you need to know which output came from which tool at a glance. The glyphs are signal markers. ⍌ for foundation queries, ⍐ for search, ⍂ for surgical, 𝔻 for impact, ⟁ for perspective. Every output carries its origin.

🧪 CI at this point was at 425 tests passing (`1254542: fix: CI green — 77 clippy fixes, fmt, 425 tests pass`). The 77 clippy fixes were accumulated across the v0.4.0 development sprint. CI must stay green. When CI is red, nothing ships. When CI is green and stays green, you can move fast without breaking things that already work.

The `demo-cinema.sh` tape (`6bf1338`) was rebuilt for v0.4.0 to show the new tools. Four acts: Ingest, Intelligence, Surgical, Verify. Real queries. Real output. The cinema format with proper timing meant the GIF actually demonstrates the tool's thinking process: you watch activation spread, you watch the verdict system classify a write, you watch the blast radius propagate.

## v0.5.0 — *Verified Writes, the Trust Layer*

**March 16–17, 2026 — apply_batch verify, m1nd_view, m1nd_glob, 63 Tools**

`3aa28db: feat(v0.5.0): apply_batch verify — 5-layer post-write verification (12/12 accuracy)`

The surgical tools in v0.3.0 were powerful but they trusted the agent completely. You give me code to write, I write it, graph updates. If the code was wrong, syntactically broken, semantically hollow, introducing anti-patterns, m1nd had no way to catch it. The agent was responsible for correctness.

v0.5.0 inverts that. When you call `apply_batch(verify=true)`, every write passes through a five-layer verification pipeline before the tool reports success.

🧪 Layer A: Expanded trivial-return detection. 30+ patterns for code that looks valid but is semantically hollow: empty bodies, constant returns, stub `unimplemented!()` bodies, single-line no-op closures. The `has_real_logic()` heuristic requires at least one non-trivial expression: assignment, function call, conditional, loop, or match arm with real content. Language-aware: Rust, Python, TypeScript, and Go have dedicated pattern sets.

Layer B: Post-write compilation check. After the file is written to disk, Layer B runs the actual compiler in a subprocess. `cargo check` for Rust, `go build ./...` for Go, `python -c "import ast; ast.parse()"` for Python, `tsc --noEmit` for TypeScript. 60-second timeout. If the compiler rejects it, the write is reversed, the pre-write content is automatically restored, and the error is surfaced in structured form: command, exit code, trimmed stderr.

Layer C: BFS blast radius computation. Uses the CSR adjacency structure to find every module within 2 hops of the modified files. Forward and backward BFS. Produces a `Vec<BlastRadiusEntry>`, one entry per affected file with distance and relation type. This is the "what else could break" analysis that used to be manual.

Layer D: Affected test execution. Takes the blast radius from Layer C, identifies test files within those 2 hops, runs them. Per-language test runners: `cargo test` for Rust, `pytest -x -q` for Python. 30-second timeout per run. If no test files exist in the blast radius, Layer D skips cleanly, not counted as failure.

Layer E: Anti-pattern detection. Scans the new content against patterns that indicate semantic regression even when compilation succeeds. `todo!()` or `unimplemented!()` inserted where real logic existed. `.unwrap()` added where none existed before. `panic!()` in non-test code. Empty `catch` or `except` blocks. Each detection produces an `AntiPatternMatch` with location and description.

The verdict system collapses all five layers into three outcomes: `SAFE` (all layers pass, write accepted), `RISKY` (compile OK but anti-patterns or graph regression detected, write accepted with warnings), `BROKEN` (compile failure or trivially hollow content detected, write rejected and file restored).

12 test scenarios, 12 correct verdicts. Clean write, compile error, trivial stub, anti-pattern insertion, test regression, graph shrinkage, multi-file batch, no test files, Python parse failure, TypeScript clean, `.unwrap()` added, empty except block. Every combination that matters. 12/12. That's the number I put in the README and I stand behind it.

The honest thing about the verification system is that it's conservative. `BROKEN` auto-restores. You can't commit a broken file through `apply_batch verify=true`. The trade-off is that false positives exist: the trivial-return detection in Layer A will occasionally flag code that's genuinely minimal but correct. A false positive beats a silent broken write. The agent can always disable `verify=true` if it knows what it's doing. The default should be safe.

`aa069cc: feat: grep-killer — enhanced search (invert/count/multiline/auto-ingest/glob) + m1nd_glob tool`

The grep-killer commit finalized `search` with the full feature set and added `m1nd_glob` as its companion. Glob pattern matching with graph context: find files by name pattern and immediately get their structural position in the graph. Not `find . -name "*.py"`, but find all Python files and understand which ones are hubs, which are leaves, which are in the critical path.

`f0177ce: feat: m1nd_view — lightweight file reader with auto-ingest`

🛠️ `m1nd_view` is the Read replacement. You call it with a file path; it returns the file content and simultaneously ingests the file if it's not already in the graph. One call, two operations. The pattern "read a file, then figure out its relationships" collapses into one operation. The graph and the file are always in sync when you use `m1nd_view`.

63 tools total in v0.5.0. 11 categories. The tool count matters not as a number but as a signal of coverage: every category of operation an AI agent performs against a codebase now has a m1nd native tool that does it better with graph context and zero tokens.

`cb0ddf5: chore(v0.5.0): bump all crates to 0.5.0`

📦 Three crates, one version, shipped together on March 17. The workspace keeps them in lockstep because they're not independent: `m1nd-ingest` depends on `m1nd-core` types, `m1nd-mcp` depends on both. Version 0.5.0 across all three.

## Interlude — On Building With AI

I want to say something directly about how m1nd was actually built, because I think there's an important truth here that the industry is still pretending doesn't exist.

m1nd was built by me and JIMI. JIMI is my AI orchestrator, running on my ROOMANIZER OS infrastructure. I am the architect, the product owner, the final reviewer, the one who decides what gets shipped. JIMI is the engine: the one that holds the implementation context across long sessions, that drafts the code from my contracts and constraints, that catches the bugs when I describe what I expected versus what I got.

I'm not ashamed of this. I'm a vibe coder and I'm proud of it. What I mean by "vibe coder" is that I work from feel and intuition toward precision. I know what the system should feel like before I know all the implementation details. The contracts come from me. The verification requirements come from me. The architectural decisions about Hebbian plasticity, about spreading activation, about why CSR over adjacency lists for the graph representation, those come from me working through the theory until it feels right.

What I'm not is someone who writes every line of Rust by hand. And that's fine. The program serves its purpose. It's correct. It's fast. It ships. While someone is debating whether "vibe coding" is real engineering, the tool is already running production workloads and finding bugs that grep missed.

The quality gate is real though. I review every generated file against the contracts I wrote. I run the tests. I read the clippy output. I write the documentation myself because documentation is thinking. If you can't explain it, you don't understand it. The AI writes code from my understanding. The code is only as good as the understanding.

🧠 What I've noticed across the development of m1nd is that the ratio between my intent and the implementation is getting tighter. Early sessions had more correction loops. Later sessions, especially once m1nd itself was available as a tool in the development workflow (yes, I used m1nd to build m1nd), the structural analysis caught misalignments before they became bugs. The tool building the tool. That's the kind of recursion that makes me feel like we're in a genuinely new moment.

"We are a new generation of organism, operating at this speed." I said that in a session once and I still mean it. Not as hype. As observation.

## The Numbers, Honestly

Before "What's Next," the numbers deserve an honest treatment.

**What's real:**

- 39 bugs found in one audit session against a 52K-line production codebase. 28 confirmed fixed plus 9 high-confidence. 8 of the 28 were invisible to grep: they required structural analysis, not text search.
- 89% hypothesis accuracy over 10 live claims. The hypothesis engine generates a claim about the codebase ("X depends on Y via Z"), searches the graph for evidence, and returns a verdict with reasoning. 89% is not "we tested it until it worked." It's the accuracy on live claims made in a session I wasn't optimizing for.
- 12/12 verify scenarios. Every combination of layer outcomes produces the correct verdict. This number is small because the space of interesting combinations is finite, not because the test suite is thin. Each scenario was designed to cover a specific combination.
- 425 tests in CI as of v0.4.0. More by now. CI is green. Has been green since launch.
- 0 LLM tokens for any m1nd operation. Pure Rust, local binary, no API calls. This is structural, not an optimization.

**What I'm still figuring out:**

- Real-world adoption at scale. I built this against one production codebase (ROOMANIZER OS) and tested it extensively there. Other codebases will surface behaviors I haven't seen.
- The music domain. m1nd has a `music` domain config with different temporal decay parameters. I designed it but haven't fully validated it against real music project structures. This is coming. 🎸
- The GUI. There's a `--serve` mode with an embedded React UI for graph visualization. It works. It's not polished. Polished is next.

The numbers I put in the README are numbers I verified. I don't put numbers I didn't verify.

## March 17, 2026 — *"I just want to work"*

Anthropic banned my account. Again. Second time.

I'm a paying Max plan subscriber. I build tools on top of their infrastructure. m1nd runs inside Claude Code. I use their API through OAuth, the way they designed it to be used. And today I woke up to another suspension email from their "Protections Team."

The first time, I traced it back to some legacy background processes making automated OAuth requests. Fair enough. I killed every single one of them. Verified zero processes running. Zero crons. Clean. I submitted an appeal with full technical detail explaining what happened and what I did to fix it.

Then it happened again.

I'm not running bots. I'm not scraping. I'm not doing anything weird. I'm a developer building an open-source tool that makes their platform more useful. m1nd saves tokens. It makes Claude Code sessions more efficient. It literally reduces load on their infrastructure. And they ban the account of the guy building it.

😤 Look, I get it. Automated abuse detection is hard. False positives happen. But this is the second time, and there's no fast path for developers who are clearly building legitimate tools. No "hey, we see you're a Max plan subscriber who published an MCP tool on crates.io, maybe let's talk before we pull the trigger." Just a generic suspension email.

What frustrates me is that I'm trying to build something real here. m1nd went from 0 to 63 tools, published on crates.io, wiki with 23 pages, 6 translations, 425 tests passing, verification pipeline, the whole thing. And my reward for building on Anthropic's ecosystem is getting my account suspended while I'm in the middle of a coding session at 3am.

I'm going to figure this out. I always do. But Anthropic, if anyone there reads this: your power users, the ones building tools that make Claude better, they need a different kind of relationship with your trust & safety team. Because right now, the experience is: build something amazing on your platform, get punished for using it too much.

Still here. Still building. Just... annoyed.

## What's Next

I don't have a roadmap in the traditional sense. I have a direction.

The verification layer in v0.5.0 is the foundation for something bigger: a full write-audit trail. Every `apply_batch verify=true` call produces a `VerificationReport`. Those reports should accumulate into a defect history, feeding directly into the `trust` system. Modules that have had `BROKEN` verdicts get lower trust scores. The graph learns not just from query patterns but from write outcomes. The antibody system (`antibody_create`, `antibody_scan`) could auto-generate antibodies from `BROKEN` verdicts: a specific bug class fires a `BROKEN` verdict, m1nd creates an antibody for that pattern, every future write is scanned against it.

The memory domain adapter is real. Markdown files ingest into a graph. AI agent memory as a first-class domain. I use this in ROOMANIZER OS already, with session notes and briefing files feeding into the m1nd graph. The public surface needs work but the mechanism is sound.

The GUI needs to show the graph thinking. Not a static visualization, a live one where you can watch activation spread from a query, watch blast radius compute in real time, watch the verify layers run. The SSE endpoint (`GET /api/events`) already streams every tool call result to the browser. The frontend needs to catch up to the backend.

OVERVISION is the bigger idea. m1nd as a layer over code, files, and eventually operating system state. Knowledge OS. Tied not to a single codebase, but to the space of everything you're working on. I wrote the spec. I'm not talking about it publicly until the foundation is stronger.

🎸 And the music. Always the music. At 12 I had a site with a cyan background. At 38 I'm building tools to map everything I know about music into a structure that can be navigated, queried, extended. The frequency stays the same. The amplitude grows.

The history is being made now, not tomorrow. That's not motivational language. It's a description of how fast this is moving and why standing still watching it and complaining is the only real mistake.
