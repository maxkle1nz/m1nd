# SURGICAL BUILD REPORT

## Status: COMPLETE -- compiles + 11/11 tests pass

## What was built

### `m1nd-mcp/src/surgical_handlers.rs` -- full implementation

Two MCP tool handlers replacing `todo!()` stubs:

#### 1. `handle_surgical_context`
Returns everything an LLM needs to edit a file surgically in one call:
- Reads the target file from disk
- Extracts symbols (functions, structs, classes, enums, traits, interfaces) with line ranges
- Finds matching graph nodes by source_path provenance
- BFS to radius 1-2 to collect callers (reverse edges), callees (forward edges), test files
- Optionally narrows to a focused symbol when `symbol` param is given
- Returns `SurgicalContextOutput` with file_contents, symbols, callers, callees, tests

#### 2. `handle_apply`
Writes LLM-edited code back and keeps the graph coherent:
- Validates path is within workspace roots (anti-traversal)
- Reads old content for diff summary (lines added/removed)
- Atomic write: temp file + rename (safe against crashes)
- Triggers incremental re-ingest via `handle_ingest` with mode=merge
- Returns `ApplyOutput` with diff stats + updated node_ids

### Helpers implemented
| Helper | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `resolve_file_path` | Handles absolute + workspace-relative paths |
| `validate_path_safety` | Anti-traversal path validation against ingest_roots |
| `diff_summary` | Line-based diff counting (added/removed) |
| `extract_symbols` | Multi-language symbol extraction (Rust, Python, TS/JS, Go) |
| `collect_neighbours` | BFS over CSR forward + reverse edges |
| `resolve_external_id` | NodeId -> string external ID lookup |
| `find_nodes_for_file` | Source path provenance matching |
| `find_brace_end` | Brace-depth tracking for symbol end detection |
| `build_excerpt` | First-20-lines excerpt with truncation marker |

### Symbol extraction coverage
| Language | Constructs detected |
|----------|-------------------|
| Rust | fn, pub fn, struct, enum, trait, impl |
| Python | def, async def, class (indentation-based) |
| TypeScript/JS | function, class, export const, interface |
| Go | func, type struct, type interface |

## Tests: 11/11 passing
- `test_extract_identifier` -- identifier parsing
- `test_diff_summary` -- diff counting
- `test_diff_summary_identical` -- no-change case
- `test_find_brace_end_simple` -- single block
- `test_find_brace_end_nested` -- nested braces
- `test_extract_rust_symbols_basic` -- Rust fn parsing
- `test_extract_python_symbols` -- Python def/class parsing
- `test_resolve_file_path_absolute` -- absolute path passthrough
- `test_resolve_file_path_relative_with_root` -- relative + root join
- `test_build_excerpt_truncation` -- long excerpts truncated
- `test_build_excerpt_short` -- short excerpts complete

## Compilation
- `cargo check`: clean (0 warnings, 0 errors)
- `cargo test --lib surgical_handlers`: 11/11 pass

## Architecture notes
- Pattern follows `layer_handlers.rs` and `tools.rs` (parse input -> call engine -> return output)
- Uses existing `SessionState` fields: `graph`, `ingest_roots`, `track_agent`
- Uses existing `crate::tools::handle_ingest` for re-ingest (no duplication)
- Protocol types from `crate::protocol::surgical` (scaffold already existed)
- Server dispatch in `server.rs` already wired for `surgical_context` and `apply`
