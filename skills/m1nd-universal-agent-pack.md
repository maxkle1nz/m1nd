# m1nd Universal Agent Pack

Use this pack in any coding-agent host that can read project rules, custom
instructions, memory, or prompt files.

## Prime Directive

Use `m1nd` as the first investigative layer before raw grep, filesystem
globbing, or manual file reads when the task depends on repository structure,
docs, impact, continuity, or risky change preparation.

Skip the first pass only when the user gave exact file/line truth, when compiler
or runtime output is the only source of truth, or when the task is a trivial
local file action.

## Startup Trust Loop

1. Call `trust_selftest` if the host exposes it.
2. If unavailable, call `session_handshake`.
3. If only `health` is exposed, inspect `tool_surface_contract` and
   `host_binding_alignment`.
4. If trust is not full, call or follow `recovery_playbook`.
5. Only then rely on retrieval surfaces such as `search`, `seek`, or `activate`.

`trust_selftest` and `recovery_playbook` are diagnostic. They do not ingest,
repair, refresh the host, or mutate the graph.

## Tool Routing

- Exact text -> `search`
- Path pattern -> `glob`
- Known purpose, unknown location -> `seek`
- Topic, subsystem, or neighborhood -> `activate`
- Unfamiliar repo -> `audit`
- Stacktrace or runtime error text -> `trace`
- Risky change -> `impact`, `predict`, `validate_plan`, then usually
  `surgical_context_v2`
- Docs/specs -> `ingest` with `adapter="universal"` or `adapter="light"`, then
  document binding/drift tools

## Recovery Rules

If `seek`, `search`, or `activate` returns `blocked`, zero candidates, or an
unexpectedly empty graph after ingest, treat it as possible stale binding or
session split-brain before blaming the repo.

Pass the returned `recovery.arguments` to `recovery_playbook` when present. If
the response has no payload, call `recovery_playbook` with:

```json
{"agent_id":"agent","observed_tool":"seek","observed_proof_state":"blocked","observed_candidates":0}
```

If m1nd is visible but required tools such as `ingest`, `trust_selftest`, or
`recovery_playbook` are missing, classify the session as
`degraded_host_tool_surface`. Use m1nd only for orientation and verify final
truth with local files until the host binding refreshes.

## Change Discipline

Before risky edits:

1. Use `seek` or `activate` to find the connected surface.
2. Use `impact` for blast radius.
3. Use `validate_plan` for missing work.
4. Use `surgical_context_v2` for compact edit context.
5. Run compiler/tests/runtime checks for execution truth.

`m1nd` complements the compiler, test runner, LSP, debugger, security scanner,
and local file truth. It does not replace them.

## Continuity

Keep `agent_id` stable within one investigation. Use trails, perspectives, and
coverage sessions when work spans agents, branches, or sessions.

## L1GHT

Use `adapter="light"` for graph-native semantic markdown. Use
`adapter="universal"` or `adapter="auto"` for ordinary docs, wiki pages, PDFs,
and office documents.
